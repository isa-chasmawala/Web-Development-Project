# Web-Development-Project
It is a tours and travel website made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.
It is a server based application and therefore you have to start a local server and database server to properly run this website. You can use Xampp or Wampp to start a server and put this repository in a folder. 
For Xampp you need place this repository at location: C:\xampp\htdocs. Then start apache and database server in xampp control panel. Then in browser type "local/<your folder name>/Homepage.html". You will see the homepage of the web site. 
You must also have database to store data of users and to retrieve data about user. To manage databases type "localhost/phpmyadmin" in browser. You can create your database or import an already existing database through this interface. If ".sql" file is available in this repository then use that file to import database. Make sure that name of the database is "trysql".
For any other web server, see how to run servers on those platforms. But database and other site related content is going to be same.
